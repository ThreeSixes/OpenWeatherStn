Arduino sensor module code:
===========================

PrecipSensor: Contains the code for the I2C precipitation sensor used to detect rainfall, and rough rainfall severity.

==================
PoC and test code:
==================

magWindVeinTest: A quick test of the HMC5883L-based weather vein sensor. This function will be migrated to the RPi since the HMC5883L supports I2C.
